### About

The change control process consists of five distinct steps:

|   | Step | Purpose |
|:-:|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Initiation** | A change request form (this document) is issued. |
| 2 | **Analysis** | The change request is analysed to determine if it has merit and should be considered. If so, additional analysis is conducted to determine what it will take to implement the change, identify project impacts, and provide any additional information that might aid decision-makers in granting or denying approval of the request. |
| 3 | **Resolution/approval** | Decision-makers consider the results of the analysis and determine if the request should be approved, denied, or if more analysis is needed. |
| 4 | **Implementation** | Approved changes are planned, scheduled, resourced and implemented. |
| 5 | **Verification and closing** | Implementation of the change is verified and the change request is closed. |

### Priority

|   | | Level | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   | 1 | _Critical_     | Work stoppage or severe impact on productivity has occurred; solution needed immediately |
|   | 2 | _High_         | Work stoppage or severe impact on productivity is eminent; solution needed before impact occurs |
| ✓ | 3 | _Medium_       | Impact on productivity is expected; workaround has been identified and solution is needed |
|   | 4 | _Low_          | Impact on productivity is minimal; solution is needed |

### Description

_Example_: Data conversion is taking more time than planned due to the condition of the source data. Data conversion tasks are on the critical path and are at risk of slippage. Adding another full-time database administrator will add needed capacity to stay on schedule.

### Justification

_Example_ Change will prevent impact on project end date due to slippage of critical path data conversion tasks.

### Status

Current status or workaround (if applicable)

### Cost

Potential cost considerations (if known)

_Example_: Staffing costs will increase by 1 full-time database administrator.

### Impact

1.  **Area**

    |   | Area | Impact |
    |:-:|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ✓ | _Project cost increase_ | change will result in an increase to project costs |
    |   | _Project cost decrease_ | change will result in a decrease to project costs |
    |   | _Scope increase_        | change will result in an increase to project scope of work |
    |   | _Scope decrease_        | change will result in a decrease to project scope of work |
    | ✓ | _Schedule change_       | change will result in a change to the master project schedule |

1.  **Metrics**

    Indicate how much was increased or decreased in cost, scope, or schedule.

    _Example_: The project cost increased by 10%.

1.  **Impact on baselined items and the project**

    _Example_: Recruit and hire one additional FT DBA, baseline budget will increase.

1.  **Implementation risks and mitigation**
